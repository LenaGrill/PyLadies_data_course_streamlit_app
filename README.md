# PyLadies_data_course_streamlit_app

## Description:
This app was created as a project for the PyLadies Vienna data course 2022. 
The used data are my own, just built from memory, so they are not complete and probably not very accurate, but something to work with.
The app works so far, but there are still a lot of ideas to implement and things to improve.

## A few additional ideas:
1. The page currently loads the coordinates again every time it is started. It could create a new list containing the coordinates that are then used further. This would shorten the loading time.
2. Link the countries to e.g. Wikipedia info site.
3. Link the individual sites (points on the map) with Wiki short description.
4. Link the individual sites with photographs or diary entries.
